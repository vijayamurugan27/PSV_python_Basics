    "Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), along with encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. It is a concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In essence, polymorphism enables objects to take on multiple forms.\n",

    "There are two main types of polymorphism in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Early Binding):\n",
    "        Also known as method overloading.\n",
    "        Occurs when you have multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different method signatures).\n",
    "        The correct method to invoke is determined at compile time based on the method's signature and the arguments provided.\n",
    "        Examples of compile-time polymorphism include function overloading in C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Late Binding):\n",
    "        Also known as method overriding.\n",
    "        Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "        The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the actual object type (dynamic type) rather than the reference type.\n",
    "        Run-time polymorphism is a key feature of inheritance and allows you to achieve \"one interface, multiple implementations.\"\n",
